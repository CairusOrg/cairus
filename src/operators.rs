//! # Overview
//!
//! This module allows Cairus to take one pixel and blend it with another pixel.  By
//! the time this module is reached, Cairus will already have figured out what pixels in the context
//! to blend with what pixels in the destination.  The purpose of this module is to provide
//! the pixel-by-pixel blending operations used in that process.
//!
//! Cairus operators are equivalent to the Porter Duff operators (See references at the bottom of
//! this page).
//!
//! # Supported Operators:
//! * Over - Cairus's default operator.  Blends a source onto a destination, similar to overlapping
//!          two semi-transparent slides.  If the source is opaque, the over operation will make
//!          the destination opaque as well.

use types::Rgba;

// Image Compositing Operations
// This section defines all functions and enums for image compositing.
//
// Adding a new operator
// To add a new operator, implement the function for the operator, create an enum for it, and then
// add the "enum => function" match in `fetch_operator`.  The new operator will now be available
// to any context via `fetch_operator`.

/// The supported image compositing operators in Cairus.
pub enum Operator {
    /// Cairus's default operator.  Draws source layer on top of destination layer.
    Over,
    ///Needed for stroke implementation. Draw source layer where there was destination layer.
    In,
    //Source will be the next operator to implement. It replaces the destination later.
    //Source,



    //Remaining operators enumerated for later implementation

/// Returns an image compositing function that corresponds to an Operator enum.
///
/// This function maps an enum to its function, allowing for dynamic determination of the operator
/// function.  This is likely a good way for a context to fetch the correct function just by having
/// an Operator enum, instead of it having to use a match statement to find the correct operator,
/// or having this fetch function implemented in the context module (away from the rest of the
/// operator definitions).
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `op` - Reference to an enum `Operator` that matches the desired operation.
///
/// # Usage
/// let op_enum = Operator::Over;
///
/// // Fetch and use the operator
/// let compose = fetch_operator(&op_enum);
/// compose(&source, &mut destination1);
