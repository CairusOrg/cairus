//! # Overview
//!
//! Image compositing operators are functions that take two colors and blend (or 'composite') them
//! them together.  Compositing red and green, for example, yields yellow.  There is one primary
//! way of representing color in Cairus, and that is the `Rgba` struct.  This defines three color
//! values (red, green, and blue), and one alpha channel (used to control opacity).  Traditional
//! formulas are used for calculating the compositing output `Rgba`, and should include the full
//! collection of Porter Duff operators. (See references for paper on Porter Duff operators)
//!
//! # Supported Operators:
//! * Over - Cairus's default operator.  Blends a source onto a destination, similar to overlapping
//!          two semi-transparent slides.  If the source is opaque, the over operation will make
//!          the destination opaque as well.
//!
//! Descriptions/formulas for Cairo operators:

/// # Rgba, the main color representation in Cairus
/// Represents color with red, green, blue, and alpha channels.
///
/// This struct is the primary way of expressing color in Cairus.  Red, green, and blue values can
/// be combined to create any color visible to the human eye, and that is exactly what the RGB
/// color model is used for.  Setting red to 1 and green and blue to 0 gives you a red color.
/// Setting green and red to 1 but blue to 0 gives you yellow.  The alpha channel (the A of RGBA)
/// sets the opacity of the color.  1 is opaque, and 0 is transparent.  Note that the minimum value
/// for any channel is 0, and the maximum value is 1.

        /// are multipled by the alpha channel's value BEFORE any compositing operation is done to
        /// the RGBA.  The reason for this is twofold:  Most operator formulas include multiplying
        /// alpha value with each color value. Pre-multiplying factors out this multiplication
        /// beforehand.  Reason two is that pre-multipling ensures that the resulting Rgba is the
        /// correct value after an operation.  See the Nvidia article in the references section
        /// below on why pre-multiplying always gives the correct result, and post multiplying
