//! The main crate for Cairus.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Cairus is a 2D graphics library based on the Cairo vector graphics library.  Cairus is designed
//! to utilize and preserve the Cairo drawing model while providing the benefits of a native Rust
//! implementation.

// Private modules
//
// We allow dead code because warnings will be thrown until in-module private functions get used
// by some public function.  We should remove these compiler flags once cairus's upper level API is
// complete.
