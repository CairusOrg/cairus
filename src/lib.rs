//! The main crate for Cairus.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Cairus is a 2D graphics library based on the Cairo vector graphics library.  Cairus is designed
//! to utilize and preserve the Cairo drawing model while providing the benefits of a native Rust
//! implementation.

/// When we get down to the level of pixels, they are blended together by operations
/// defined in the operators module.
