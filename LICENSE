Every source file in the implementation[*] of cairus is available to be
redistributed and/or modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public
License (MPL) version 1.1.  Some files are available under more
liberal terms, but we believe that in all cases, each file may be used
under either the LGPL or the MPL.

Please see each file in the implementation for copyright and licensing

[*] The implementation of cairus is contained entirely within the "src"
directory of the cairus source distribution. There are other components
of the cairus source distribution (such as the "test", "util", and "perf")
that are auxiliary to the library itself. None of the source code in these
directories contributes to a build of the cairus library itself.
